		    Manju's art practice explores notions of home, belonging, displacement and memory. Home to her is a transient map that is constantly drawing connections between cultures, geographies, languages and collective histories. Having moved homes across multiple cities, the repeated change of environment has always triggered questions about ideas of belonging - to places, spaces and times. In these inquiries surface nostalgia and memory, and a re-look into her personal history and identity with a renewed curiosity.

                    <p class="work-title">
Through minimalist drawings and metaphorical landscapes interspersed with maps and text and remembered verse, she negotiates these notions of home. Manju often uses photographs, layers them and stitches them together to create her personal landscapes that enquire into these ideas of displacement and belonging.

                    <p class="work-title">
	In her recent series of work, she engages with words, the language of the region she currently live in and intersperses it with her native script, attempting to articulate her fluid, unresolved state of being.
