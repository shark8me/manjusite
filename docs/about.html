Manju's art practice explores the idea of home beyond an address or a space. It is a transient map that is constantly drawing connections between cultures, geographies, languages and collective histories. Having moved homes across multiple cities, the repeated change of environment triggers inquiries into ideas of belonging - to places, spaces and times. In these inquiries surface nostalgia and memory, and a re-look into her personal history and identity with a renewed curiosity. 
Through minimalist drawings and metaphorical landscapes interspersed with maps and text, and more recently, remembered verse, she negotiates these notions of displacement, memory and belonging. 
In her recent series of work, adapting the medium of sumi ink painting into her practice, she plays with her native script, and attempts to articulate her fluid, unresolved state of being.
